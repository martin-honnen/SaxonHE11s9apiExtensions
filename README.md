# Saxon HE 11 s9api .NET extension method helps
Extension methods that help/ease the task of using Saxon HE 11 Java s9api from .NET code

This is a sample project outlining my successful attempt to use https://github.com/ikvm-revived/ikvm and
https://github.com/ikvm-revived/ikvm-maven to use the open-source Saxon HE 11 Java XSLT 3.0, XQuery 3.1 and XPath 3.1 library in .NET 6 code.

Please understand that this is my own experiment, it uses the official Saxon HE 11 release from Maven, but the integration with IKVM and IKVM Maven is an experimental work of my own, not in any way an officially tested and supported product by Saxonica, the company that has produces Saxon.

So feel free to use to try and use it under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. 

Understand that this is work in progress and kind of experimental, I don't have access to a complete test suite of unit tests to rigorously test this, I nevertheless feel it can be useful for folks to at least know about this option to run XSLT 3.0, XPath 3.1 and XQuery 3.1 in .NET 6 code.
